# pythonocr

This is an example of using tesseract OCR.

You have to download and install tesseract on your local machine for this to work.

The image_process program takes an image and crops it and scales it to a level where tesseract can work effectively.

The tesseract will do OCR on the image and return the text.

You have to install pandas and xlrd as well.
